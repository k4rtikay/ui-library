# Introduction
Welcome to **Flow-Kit**.

Flow-Kit is a collection of high-quality, animated components built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).

While shadcn/ui provides the robust, accessible primitives (buttons, inputs, dialogs), Flow-Kit focuses on the **interactions**—the subtle details, micro-animations, and physics-based transitions that make an interface feel alive.

## Philosophy

Most component libraries focus on *structure*. We focus on *feeling*.

We believe that animation shouldn't be an afterthought or a "nice-to-have." It is a core part of the user experience that guides attention, provides feedback, and creates a sense of spatial consistency.

**Flow-Kit is:**

- **Copy-paste friendly:** Just like shadcn/ui, you own the code.
- **Built on Framer Motion:** The industry standard for React animation.
- **Accessible:** Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Why Motion?

In modern web development, we often stop at "functional." A button clicks, a modal opens, a list renders.

But software is more than functionality; it is an experience. Motion acts as the connective tissue between states:
* **Context:** Where did this element come from?
* **Feedback:** Did my action succeed?
* **Delight:** Does using this tool feel good?

This library aims to bridge the gap between a static design system and a fluid user experience.

## Usage

Flow-Kit is not a dependency you install. It is a reference you copy from.

We take standard shadcn components and wrap them with meaningful interactions. You don't need to rebuild your design system; you just upgrade the parts that need to pop.
